# Multi-Tenant BI Platform with ETL Pipeline - Interview Questions & Answers

## Project Overview
A Multi-Tenant BI Platform with ETL Pipeline is a comprehensive data solution that enables multiple organizations (tenants) to securely access their own data through a shared infrastructure while maintaining data isolation and providing business intelligence capabilities through automated ETL processes and interactive dashboards.

---

## **1. Project Architecture & Design Questions**

### Q1: Can you explain the overall architecture of your Multi-Tenant BI Platform?

**Answer:**
Our Multi-Tenant BI Platform follows a modern cloud-based architecture with the following key components:

- **Data Sources Layer**: Multiple tenant databases, APIs, and file systems
- **ETL Pipeline Layer**: Azure Data Factory/SSIS for data extraction, transformation, and loading
- **Data Storage Layer**: 
  - Raw Data Lake (Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2)
  - Staging Area (SQL Server/Azure SQL Database)
  - Data Warehouse (Azure Synapse Analytics/SQL Server)
- **Processing Layer**: Azure Databricks for complex transformations
- **Semantic Layer**: SSAS Tabular Models or Power BI Datasets
- **Presentation Layer**: Power BI dashboards and reports
- **Security Layer**: Row-level security, tenant isolation, and access controls

The platform uses a **shared database with tenant isolation** approach, where we maintain data separation through tenant IDs and implement row-level security.

### Q2: How do you handle multi-tenancy in your BI platform?

**Answer:**
We implement multi-tenancy using several strategies:

**Data Isolation:**
- Tenant ID column in all tables for logical separation
- Row-Level Security (RLS) in Power BI and SQL Server
- Separate schemas per tenant in some cases

**Security Model:**
```sql
-- Example RLS filter
CREATE FUNCTION dbo.fn_securitypredicate(@TenantId AS nvarchar(128))
    RETURNS TABLE
WITH SCHEMABINDING
AS
    RETURN SELECT 1 AS fn_securitypredicate_result
    WHERE @TenantId = USER_NAME() OR USER_NAME() = 'dbo'
```

**Configuration Management:**
- Tenant-specific configuration tables
- Dynamic connection strings based on tenant context
- Parameterized ETL processes

**Resource Allocation:**
- Shared compute resources with tenant-based usage monitoring
- Separate Power BI workspaces per tenant
- Configurable refresh schedules per tenant

---

## **2. ETL Pipeline Questions**

### Q3: Describe your ETL process and the tools you used.

**Answer:**
Our ETL pipeline is built using a combination of tools:

**Extraction:**
- **Azure Data Factory** for cloud-based sources
- **SSIS packages** for on-premises databases
- **REST APIs** for SaaS applications
- **File watchers** for automatic data ingestion

**Transformation:**
- **Data transformation flows** in Azure Data Factory
- **Azure Databricks** for complex business logic
- **SQL Server stored procedures** for database-level transformations
- **Power Query** for lightweight transformations

**Loading:**
- **Bulk insert operations** for large datasets
- **Incremental loading** strategies using Change Data Capture (CDC)
- **Delta format** in Data Lake for versioning

**Example ETL Flow:**
```sql
-- Incremental loading logic
MERGE TargetTable AS target
USING (SELECT * FROM StagingTable WHERE ModifiedDate > @LastRunDate) AS source
ON target.Id = source.Id
WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET ...
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT ...
```

### Q4: How do you handle data quality and validation in your ETL pipeline?

**Answer:**
We implement multiple layers of data quality controls:

**Source Data Validation:**
- Schema validation before processing
- Data type checks and constraints
- Null value handling policies
- Duplicate detection and removal

**Transformation Validation:**
- Business rule validation during transformation
- Data profiling and anomaly detection
- Custom validation functions

**Error Handling:**
```python
# Example data quality check in Databricks
def validate_data_quality(df):
    quality_checks = {
        'null_checks': df.filter(col('customer_id').isNull()).count() == 0,
        'date_range': df.filter(col('order_date') > current_date()).count() == 0,
        'negative_amounts': df.filter(col('amount') < 0).count() == 0
    }
    
    failed_checks = [check for check, passed in quality_checks.items() if not passed]
    
    if failed_checks:
        raise ValueError(f"Data quality checks failed: {failed_checks}")
    
    return df
```

**Monitoring & Alerting:**
- Data quality dashboards
- Automated email alerts for failures
- SLA monitoring for data freshness

## **3. Database Design & Data Modeling Questions**

### Q5: How did you design your data warehouse schema?

**Answer:**
We implemented a **hybrid approach** combining dimensional modeling with modern data warehouse patterns:

**Staging Layer:**
- Raw data tables with minimal transformation
- Audit columns (created_date, modified_date, tenant_id)
- Error logging tables

**Core Data Warehouse:**
```sql
-- Fact table example
CREATE TABLE fact_sales (
    sale_id BIGINT IDENTITY(1,1),
    tenant_id NVARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    customer_key INT,
    product_key INT,
    date_key INT,
    sales_amount DECIMAL(18,2),
    quantity INT,
    created_date DATETIME2 DEFAULT GETUTCDATE()
);

-- Dimension table example
CREATE TABLE dim_customer (
    customer_key INT IDENTITY(1,1),
    tenant_id NVARCHAR(50),
    customer_id NVARCHAR(50),
    customer_name NVARCHAR(255),
    customer_category NVARCHAR(50),
    valid_from DATETIME2,
    valid_to DATETIME2,
    is_current BIT
);
```

**Key Design Principles:**
- **Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD Type 2)** for historical tracking
- **Surrogate keys** for all dimensions
- **Tenant isolation** through tenant_id in all tables
- **Star schema** for optimal query performance
- **Bridge tables** for many-to-many relationships

### Q6: Explain how you implemented Slowly Changing Dimensions.

**Answer:**
We implemented **SCD Type 2** to maintain historical data:

```sql
-- SCD Type 2 Implementation
CREATE PROCEDURE usp_UpdateCustomerDimension
    @TenantId NVARCHAR(50),
    @CustomerId NVARCHAR(50),
    @CustomerName NVARCHAR(255),
    @CustomerCategory NVARCHAR(50)
AS
BEGIN
    -- Close current record
    UPDATE dim_customer 
    SET valid_to = GETUTCDATE(),
        is_current = 0
    WHERE tenant_id = @TenantId 
        AND customer_id = @CustomerId 
        AND is_current = 1
        AND (customer_name != @CustomerName OR customer_category != @CustomerCategory);
    
    -- Insert new record
    INSERT INTO dim_customer (tenant_id, customer_id, customer_name, customer_category, valid_from, valid_to, is_current)
    VALUES (@TenantId, @CustomerId, @CustomerName, @CustomerCategory, GETUTCDATE(), '9999-12-31', 1);
END
```

**Benefits:**
- Complete audit trail of changes
- Point-in-time reporting capabilities
- Support for trend analysis over time

## **4. Power BI & Visualization Questions**

### Q7: How did you implement security in Power BI for multi-tenant scenarios?

**Answer:**
We implemented a comprehensive security model:

**Row-Level Security (RLS):**
```dax
-- RLS filter in Power BI
[TenantId] = USERNAME()
```

**Dynamic Security:**
```dax
-- Dynamic security with user mapping
VAR CurrentUser = USERNAME()
VAR UserTenant = 
    LOOKUPVALUE(
        UserTenantMapping[TenantId],
        UserTenantMapping[Username], CurrentUser
    )
RETURN
    [TenantId] = UserTenant
```

**Workspace Security:**
- Separate workspaces per tenant when required
- Azure AD groups for access control
- Premium Per User licensing for advanced features

**Data Gateway Security:**
- On-premises data gateway with service accounts
- Encrypted connections to data sources
- Regular credential rotation

### Q8: What DAX measures and calculations did you create?

**Answer:**
We created comprehensive business metrics using DAX:

```dax
-- Revenue calculations
Total Revenue = SUM(fact_sales[sales_amount])

Previous Month Revenue = 
CALCULATE(
    [Total Revenue],
    DATEADD(DimDate[Date], -1, MONTH)
)

Revenue Growth % = 
DIVIDE(
    [Total Revenue] - [Previous Month Revenue],
    [Previous Month Revenue],
    0
)

-- Customer analytics
Customer Count = DISTINCTCOUNT(fact_sales[customer_key])

Average Order Value = 
DIVIDE(
    [Total Revenue],
    DISTINCTCOUNT(fact_sales[sale_id])
)

-- Time intelligence
YTD Revenue = 
CALCULATE(
    [Total Revenue],
    DATESYTD(DimDate[Date])
)

-- Dynamic filtering
Top N Products = 
VAR TopN = 10
VAR ProductRanking = 
    RANKX(
        ALL(DimProduct[product_name]),
        [Total Revenue],
        ,DESC
    )
RETURN
    IF(ProductRanking <= TopN, [Total Revenue], BLANK())
```

SUMX(
    SUMMARIZE(
        fact_sales,
        DimDate[Year],
        DimDate[Month],
        "MonthlyRevenue", SUM(fact_sales[sales_amount])
    ),
    [MonthlyRevenue]
)
```
